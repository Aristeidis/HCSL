The Hellenic Complex Systems Laboratory (HCSL) is a virtual research laboratory, devoted to the transdisciplinary study of complex systems. Founded in 1993 in Drama, Greece, has been owned and operated by the Chatzimichail family since then.

Our research has been focused on the optimization of non-linear multiparameter processes and the development of clinical, laboratory, and research tools. We have been working on the design, evaluation, and optimization of the statistical quality control of the clinical laboratories, on the evaluation and expression of the measurement uncertainty, on the evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy, and on the risk management in laboratory medicine. In addition, we have explored applications of the network science, the process of the genetic search of the genetic algorithms (GAs), and the statistics of complexity.

Our research and the tools we have developed are based mainly on genetic algorithms, numerical methods, simulation, and symbolic computation.

We have invented the genetic algorithms based design of the statistical quality control (see An introduction to the GAs based QC).

The HCSL has been a founding node of the Network of Excellence in Evolutionary Computing (Evonet). It has been participating on standards-developing committees of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and is a member organization of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL).
