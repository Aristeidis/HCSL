The Hellenic Complex Systems Laboratory (HCSL) is a virtual research laboratory, devoted to the transdisciplinary study of complex systems. Founded in 1993 in Drama, Greece, it has been owned and operated by the Chatzimichail family since then.

Our research has been focused on the optimization of non-linear multiparameter processes and the development of clinical, laboratory, research, and educational tools (see HCSL publications). We have been working on the design, evaluation, and optimization of statistical quality control (QC) in clinical laboratories, on the evaluation and expression of measurement uncertainty, on the evaluation of diagnostic accuracy, and on risk management in laboratory medicine. In addition, we have explored applications of the network science, the process of the genetic search of genetic algorithms (GAs), and the statistics of complexity.

In 1993, we invented the genetic algorithms based design of statistical quality control (see An introduction to design and optimization of statistical QC). In 2009, we developed a theoretical framework and an algorithm for the optimization of statistical QC of an analytical process, based on the reliability of the analytical system and the risk of the analytical error (see A note on the reliability and risk based optimization of statistical QC).

The HCSL has been a founding node of the Network of Excellence in Evolutionary Computing (Evonet). It has been participating on standards-developing committees of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and is a member organization of the Consortium for the Barcode of Life (CBOL).
